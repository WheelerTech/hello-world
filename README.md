today 5/16/2020 I am in Bali, Indonesia. Having recently completed the Zero to Mastery Python course, I am ready to start tacking some personal projects. For the 8 years, I've been a technical recruiter for startups in NYC, but I want to widen my skillset so I can tinker and build things with my computer.
